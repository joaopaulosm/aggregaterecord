/*
 * Per-record processing hook.
 *
 * A publisher (e.g. the pvxs TableSource) installs a pointer to one of these in
 * the record's RPVT field. aggregateRecord's process() invokes notify() at the end
 * of processing, while the record lock is held and the per-column CHGD flags are
 * still valid for the current cycle. notify() recovers its full context from
 * prec->rpvt (this struct is the first member of the publisher's context), so no
 * separate user-data argument is needed. The record itself stays agnostic of the
 * publisher: if RPVT is NULL the hook is simply a no-op.
